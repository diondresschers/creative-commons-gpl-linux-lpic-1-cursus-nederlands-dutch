ifconfig

sudo /etc/init.d/network # stop start restart status <ENTER>

of

sudo /etc/init.d/networking # stop status 

---

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 up

---

eth toegevoegd
ifconfig -a # all (also up or down), when you just added a new card
sudo ifconfig eth1 192.168.4.11 netmask 255.255.255.0
ifconfig

sudo lsmod | grep -i net
sudo rmmod vboxnetadp # nu met ifconfig -a dan is er nixs

---

ping 

netstat (alle sockets)
netstat -n # give numbers
netstat -ntu # now only Tcp and Udp # empty
netstat -tuna # now only Tcp and Udp # -> all (works!!)

netstat -r # shows the routing table, same as 'route'
netstat -r # shows the routing table give NUMBERS not 'GW' etc.

route del default
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1

tip: gebruik ip adres eerst om te testen, als dat werkt doe dhcp

route -n

route default 192.168.1.1
ip route default 192.168.1.1
route add default gw 192.168.1.1

Which statement is true regarding the following /etc/resolv.conf file?
search example.com
127.0.0.1
208.77.188.166


There is a syntax error
If DNS queries to the localhost fail, the server 208.77.188.166 will be queried
example.com will be appended to all host lookups
The DNS servers at 127.0.0.1 and 208.77.188.166 will be queried in a round robin fashion
The DNS server with the shortest ping time will be queried first. If the lookup fails, the second server will
be queried
